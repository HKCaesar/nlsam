NLSAM
=====

The reference implementation for the Non Local Spatial and Angular Matching (NLSAM) denoising algorithm for dMRI.

I am currently in the process of making everything more user friendly, so the code is on the dev branch currently.
This should be updated relatively soon with a nice version without the debug prints, but if you need help while I clena out stuff (or it is taking too long to your liking), feel free to drop me an email.
