The reference implementation for the Non Local Spatial and Angular Matching (NLSAM) denoising algorithm for diffusion MRI.

## How to install

Go grab a [release][] (recommended) or build it from source with the [instructions](#Dependencies).
You can also download the datasets used in the paper over [here][nlsam_data].

## Using the NLSAM algorithm

Once installed, there are two main scripts, the stabilization algorithm and the NLSAM algorithm itself.
The first one allows you to transform the data to Gaussian distributed signals if your dataset is Rician or Noncentral chi distributed.

You can find a detailed example and dataset in the [example](example) folder.

## Dependencies

You will need to have at least numpy, scipy, nibabel, dipy, cython, cython-gsl and spams installed with python 2.7.
Fortunately, the setup.py will take care of installing everything you need.

+ On Debian/Ubuntu, you will need some development headers which can be installed with
```shell
sudo apt-get install build-essential libgsl0-dev python-dev libopenblas-dev libopenblas-base liblapack-dev
```

Of course feel free to use your favorite blas/lapack implementation (such as intel MKL),
but I got 5x faster runtimes out of openblas vs atlas for NLSAM just by switching libraries.

+ On Windows and Mac OSX, it will be easier to grab a python distribution which includes everything such as [Anaconda][].
Additionally, grab a build of spams for windows [here][spams-windows] if you don't want to build it.

If you have a working python setup already, doing

```shell
pip install https://github.com/samuelstjean/nlsam/archive/master.zip --user --process-dependency-links
```

should give you everything you need.

You can also clone it locally and then build the files with

```shell
git clone https://github.com/samuelstjean/nlsam.git
cd nlsam
python setup.py build_ext -i
```

Don't forget to add the path where you cloned everything to your PYTHONPATH.
